These three scripts are for one speleothem sample (LUM4347) in Zhang et al. (2024).

Dose rate simulation.R simulates the dose rate change over time (due to U series disequilibrium) since the speleothem crystallization.

Age iteration.R uses the iteration method to correct for the apparent age calculated from the dose rate at equilibrium. This method is based on Ikeya and Ohmura (1983).
